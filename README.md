# Computational Statistics Project 2

Building interpretable models to link a large set of potential covariates to a binary response is a challenging venture, with different methods offering varied solutions but no definitive answer.  

This paper will focus on this challenge by investigating the validity of logistic regression p-values in high-dimensional settings.
The primary objective will be replicating and explaining the complexities arising from inflated p-values. Then, to address this challenge, Conditional Randomization Tests will be discussed, offering a valid method for statistical inference.
